    "# AgentCore Gateway Interceptor - Header Propagation Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Many enterprises face a critical security challenge when building AI agent systems that access downstream APIs through MCP servers. The core problem is secure token exchange and identity propagation in multi-hop workflows where agents call tools that subsequently call downstream APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enterprises need to exchange tokens to send scoped down tokens and, least-privilege credentials to downstream APIs from MCP servers. This requires extracting principal identity and metadata from inbound JWT tokens, performing fine-grained access control based on caller credentials, and dynamically exchanging tokens to obtain appropriately scoped credentials for specific downstream API calls.\n",
    "Organizations cannot simply forward the original authorization token to downstream services. If downstream services are compromised, the original token could be stolen and misused. Downstream services might have broader permissions than intended for specific operations, creating privilege escalation risks. The Confused Deputy problem emerges when services act on behalf of users without proper context validation, and tracking which service accessed what resource on behalf of which user becomes difficult without a proper audit trail. The problem intensifies in multi-tenant MCP server environments where different users from different tenants or organizations access the same AgentCore Gateway. These environments require strict data separation between tenants, each with different downstream API access patterns and permissions. The act-on-behalf pattern must be enforced consistently across all tenants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a mechanism to pass inbound tokens to an intermediary layer, enterprises cannot validate token authenticity, apply fine-grained access control policies before token exchange, generate appropriately scoped tokens for specific downstream API calls, maintain proper execution context throughout multi-hop workflows, or ensure tenant isolation in shared infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentCore Gateway addresses this through its Gateway interceptor and AWS Lambda target. Both AWS Lambda target integration and Gateway interceptor, serves as a layer of abstraction to perform token exchange before calling downstream APIs.  In this example, we show how you can  pass the inbound token to the AWS Lambda target function via custom headers using Gateway interceptor, perform validity checks including token signature verification and expiration checks, apply fine-grained access control based on the extracted principal, exchange the token for a narrowly scoped token specific to the downstream API, and call downstream APIs with the newly exchanged, least-privilege token.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution enables a secure act-on-behalf pattern where each hop gets separate scoped tokens, JWT-based execution context propagation that maintains user identity throughout the workflow, tenant isolation for proper data separation, clear audit trails for compliance, and decoupled security that keeps MCP schema intact while handling authentication separately\n",
